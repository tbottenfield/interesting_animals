=================================================

**Habitat**

Can be found in oak or pine woods. Likes to breed in deciduous
or mixed woods. Blue Jays also enjoy well-wooded suburbs or city parks.

====================================

**What Do They Eat?**

Blue Jays gobble down insects, nuts, and seeds. They will also feast on
small vertebrates. Blue Jays like to hold their food with their feet while 
pecking at them. If they aren't hungry, Blue Jays will store food in catches
to eat later.

==========================================


**Breeding**

The male might chase or feed the female. Soon after, 4 or so blue eggs
will appear in the nest. This is where baby jays come from. Both parents 
help incubate the eggs. The new babies will leave the nest around 3 weeks
after being born.
