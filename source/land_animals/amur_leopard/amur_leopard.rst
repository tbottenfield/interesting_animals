**Location**

Most people, when presented with the term "leopard", think of the African safaris and wild jungles. The amur leopard, however, wants none of that. This cat hails from the northern tundra - Russia, to be exact. They are located in boreal forests near the Amur River in Russia, as well as the Jilin Province of China. 

===============================================================================

**Unique Features**

To deal with the freezing winters of Russia, amur leopards grow their fur anywhere between 2.5 CM and 7.5 CM depending on the season. This allows them to live in such cold temperatures for long periods of time - adult amur leopards can live up to 10-15 years in the wild. 

However, amur leopards are critically endangered. It is unclear how many are currently in the wild, but many experts can safely say that the number is less than 100. There are many organizations dedicated to the conservation and protection of amur leopards, two of which can be found `here <http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/amur_leopard2/>`_ and `here. <http://www.altaconservation.org/amur-leopard/amur-leopard-factfile/>`_

===============================================================================

**Reproduction**

Amur leopards begin mating when they reach 3-4 years of age. The gestation period is around 12 weeks, after which the cubs are born. The number of cubs varies between 1 and 4, but the usual litter size is 2. The cubs breastfeed from the mother until they are around 3 months old and can eat meat.
