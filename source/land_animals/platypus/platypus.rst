**Unique Features**

Where do we even begin? The platypus is Darwin's nightmare. With the body of a beaver, nose/bill of a duck, and reproductive system of a bird, the platypus is, quite simply, a goofy animal. Its body is built like a beaver to be productive in water as well as on land, with multiple layers of fur, fat, and muscle. 

One lesser-known fact about platypuses is that males have two spurs on their back feet that contain a poison. This venom is potent enough to kill small animals, and when a human is stung, it creates a serious amount of pain. Make sure you think twice before picking one of these cuddly fur balls up!

**Location**

Pangolins make their homes in Africa, preferring sandy soils and savannas. Try saying that five times fast! They are most located in central and southern Africa regions.

**Reproduction**

Platypuses become sexually active at around 2 years of age. Although the male has no part in caring for the young, the female digs a trench to store the eggs after they are released - usually around 21 days after mating. This trench is blocked with plugs to prevent predators and waters from harming the young. The gestation period outside of the female is between 10 to 14 days. After this, the young hatch and feed from the mother's milk until they reach 3 months old.
