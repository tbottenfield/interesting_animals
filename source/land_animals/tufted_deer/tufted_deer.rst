**Reproduction**

While students are worrying about final projects and tests, tufted deer are holding their mating season. Tufted deer mate between late fall and early winter, often producing just 1 child, although twins aren't too rare. The males use barking noises to communicate to the females that they are ready to mate. After a gestation period of around 180 days (toward the beginning of summer), the fawn(s) are born.
