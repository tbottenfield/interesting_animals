===========================================================

**Location**

Vampire squid are found in many areas relatively close to the coastlines of most continents. They do, however, occupy deep underwater in depths ranging from 600-1,200 meters. At these depths, very little light can penetrate through the surface.

===========================================================

**Feeding**

Being a carnivore, the vampire squid is reported to feed on copepods like shrimp and other small crustaceans. They can also feed specific cnidarians (corals, jellyfish). They use sensory filaments and light-producing organs at their arm tips to attract and find food. They can also be used to distract and evade certain predators.

===========================================================

**Movement**

Known to have weak muscles, the vampire squid was always thought to be a slow swimmer. However, it was recently found that the can swim rapidly for short periods of time by using their fins. They also have a robust statocyst, which is an organ that aids in balance. When threatened, the creature can emit a jet of water from its mantle to aid in an escape.

===========================================================

**Defensive Posture**

In extreme cases, the vampire squid has a threat response called the "pumpkin" or "pineapple" posture. The squid inverts its caped arms over its body, allowing it to appear as a much larger form covered in threatening (but harmless) spikes. The vampire squids arms stay clustered together above its head, glowing, in order to divert a predator's attack away from critical areas. If the squid happens to lose the tip of an arm, it can be regenerated.
