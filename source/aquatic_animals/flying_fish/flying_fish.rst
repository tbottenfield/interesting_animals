**An actual flying fish?**

Unlike what its name seems to suggest, the flying fish does not actually fly. Instead, it leaps and glides considerable distances above the surface in order to help the fish avoid predators.

===========================================================

**Predators**

A flying fish has many predators. Creatures that these fish are trying to "fly" away from include mackerel, tuna, swordfish, marlin, and many other larger fish. Unfortunately, even while gliding in the air to avoid predators, the flying fish can become victim to birds as well.

Flying fish are caught and eaten in places like Japan, Vietnam, and China. It's a common component of seafood dishes, and is often used to make types of sushi. It's a main source of food in the diet of the Tao people in Taiwan. Flying fish are typically caught while they are gliding by the use of nets.
