**Location**

The mimic octopus is a type of octopus found mainly in areas of South East Asia. In particular, they range from the Red Sea (west) to New Caledonia (east), and also from Thailand/Philippines (north) to the Great Barrier Reef (south). Most have been found in the waters near Indonesia. The mimic octopus prefers muddy sea floors so it can blend with its natural brown color.

**Feeding**

Scientists have observed this octopus stalking smaller fish, catching, and then eating them. More often though, the mimic octopus forages for its food. It glides over sand searching for prey, and it uses its slender tentacles to reach into tighter spaces in coral. In doing this, the octopus can use its suction cups to grab small crustaceans.

**Mimicry**

Mimicry is a common survival technique found in nature. As an example, flies can have black and yellow stripes to mimic bees. This can discourage potential predators from attacking. In a similar fashion, the mimic octopus uses camouflage and changes in shape to mimic other creatures. In fact, the mimic octopus is the first known species to mimic more than one other species. Some of the more common animals imitated include: the lion fish, sea snakes, flatfish, and jellyfish. By impersonating these creatures, the octopus can oftentimes deter its predators.

Sea Snake          Hides in hole besides two legs in opposite directions.
Flatfish           Pulls arms together to one side, flattens body.
