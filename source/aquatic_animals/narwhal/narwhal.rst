**Location**

The narwhal is found mainly in the Atlantic and Russian areas of the Arctic Ocean, although stray individuals have been found in spots near the eastern coast of Greenland. They tend to stay near coasts, and they can survive depths of up to 1,500 meters below sea level. 

===========================================================

**Feeding**

In terms of diet, narwhals tend to only feed on halibut, cod, cuttlefish, shrimp, and armhook squid. The whales don't have well-developed teeth, so they're believed to eat by swimming towards prey and then sucking in with force when food is close to their mouths. A study conducted in the late 1900s tested stomach contents of an entire tracked pod of 73 narwhals. It was found that arctic cod made up about 51% of the narwhals' diet, with the next common animal fed on being halibut at 37%. The dietary needs of narwhals don't differ among genders or ages.

===========================================================

**Sound**

Narwhals use sound to navigate and hunt for food. Clicking and whistling sounds are created via air channels near their blow-holes and are then used for echo-location. It's possible that some noises are used by the whales to disorientate or incapacitate prey, making them easier to hunt.

===========================================================

**Predators**

Nearly all modern killings of narwhals are caused by humans. Otherwise, predators can include polar bears, Greenland sharks, and walruses. Polar bears, in particular, can attack breathing holes in an attempt to catch young narwhals. Killer whales have also been known to group together in order to overwhelm narhwal pods. As a defense mechanism, narwhals often use prolonged submergence to hide under ice flows as opposed to relying on speed.
